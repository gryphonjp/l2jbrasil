# This is the server configuration file. Here you can set up the connection for your server.
# Usually you have to change the ExternalHostname option to
# - 127.0.0.1 (if you want to play alone / testing purpose)
# - LAN IP* (if you want to play from another computer in the network)
# - WAN IP** (if you want to play with friends over internet)
# - Questions? => http://l2jserver.com
#
# * = If you want to get your LAN IP, simply choose "Start" => "Run..." then type "cmd" => "ipconfig"
# **= If you want to get you WAN IP, visit http://www.whatismyip.com
