		 * This text was wrote by XaKa QuestList packet structure: { 1 byte - 0x80 2 byte - Number of Quests for Quest in AvailibleQuests { 4 byte - Quest ID 4 byte - Quest Status } } NOTE: The following special constructs are true for the 4-byte Quest Status: If the most significant bit is 0, this
		 * means that no progress-step got skipped. In this case, merely passing the rank of the latest step gets the client to mark it as current and mark all previous steps as complete. If the most significant bit is 1, it means that some steps may have been skipped. In that case, each bit
		 * represents a quest step (max 30) with 0 indicating that it was skipped and 1 indicating that it either got completed or is currently active (the client will automatically assume the largest step as active and all smaller ones as completed). For example, the following bit sequences will
		 * yield the same results: 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 1111 1111: Indicates some steps may be skipped but each of the first 10 steps did not get skipped and current step is the 10th. 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1010: Indicates that no steps were skipped and current is the 10th. It
		 * is speculated that the latter will be processed faster by the client, so it is preferred when no steps have been skipped. However, the sequence "1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010 1101 1111" indicates that the current step is the 10th but the 6th and 9th are not to be shown at all (not
		 * completed, either).
