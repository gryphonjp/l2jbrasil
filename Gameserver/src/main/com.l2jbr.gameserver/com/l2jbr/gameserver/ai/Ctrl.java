/**
 * Interface of AI and client state. To correctly send messages to client we need it's state. For example, if we've sent 'StartAutoAttack' message, we need to send 'StopAutoAttack' message before any other action. Or if we've sent 'MoveToPawn', we need to send 'StopMove' when the movement of a
 * character is canceled (by Root spell or any other reason). Thus, we need to know the state of client, i.e. which messages we've sent and how the client will show the scene. Close to this task is the task of AI. If a player's character is attacking a mob, his ATTACK may be iterrupted by an event,
 * that temporary disable attacking. But when the possibility to ATTACK will be enabled, the character must continue the ATTACK. For mobs it may be more complex, since we want them to decide when to use magic, or when to follow the player for physical combat, or when to escape, to help another mob,
 * etc. This interface is hiding complexity of server<->client interaction and multiple states of a character. It allows to set a desired, simple "wish" of a character, and the implementation of this interface will take care about the rest. The goal of a character may be like "ATTACK", "random walk"
 * and so on. To reach the goal inplementation will split it into several small actions, several steps (possibly repeatable). Like "run to target" then "hit it", then if target is not dead - repeat. This flow of simplier steps may be interrupted by incoming events. Like a character's movement was
 * disabled (by Root spell, for instance). Depending on character's ability AI may choose to wait, or to use magic ATTACK and so on. Additionally incoming events are compared with client's state of the character, and required network messages are sent to client's, i.e. if we have incoming event that
 * character's movement was disabled, it causes changing if its behavour, and if client's state for the character is "moving" we send messages to clients to stop the avatar/mob.
