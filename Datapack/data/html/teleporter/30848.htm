<html><body>Gatekeeper Elisabeth:<br>
I am Gatekeeper Elisabeth. I was sent from the Ivory Tower to guard the Gate of Space and Time. Aden Castle is well-Known as a center of politics, culture and religion, although I haven't seen much of it, I've been so busy... Ironic for a person who spends her days transporting people instantaneously to far-away places... It's ridiculous, actually.<br>
