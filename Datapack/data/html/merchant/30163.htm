Hello! Welcome to the Ivory Tower!<br> 
Most people consider the Ivory Tower as a den of Mystics, but there are many other types of people there as well. Like me! At one time I was a Paladin pledged to Einhasad. It's not that I've broken my pledge...<br> 
Strange things happen here sometimes! Honestly, I can't think too much about it or I'll go mad! Just a word of warning... Don't stick you nose into too many dark corners in the Ivory Tower! You could lose it and a lot more!<br>
