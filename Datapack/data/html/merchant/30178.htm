Ah, welcome to fairest store in northern Aden.<br>
Don't listen to those rumors about me, I beg you. Lies, all lies! My competitors spread these slanders, telling my customers nonsense that I'm some wanted man escaped from Elmore or even a Timac Orc in disguise. Bah! I should wring the necks of those rascals! Oh, forgive me -- I didn't mean to upset you.<br>
Please, look over my wares and let me know how I can serve you.<br>
