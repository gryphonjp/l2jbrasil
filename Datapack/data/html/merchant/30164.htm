Greetings, and welcome to the Ivory Tower, the source of all things magical!<br> 
Many people mistakenly believe that this is merely a research institute. Actually, at one time, the Ivory Tower was at the center of an awesome power that could sway the entire continent! Would you care to guess where all the records are stored? Why here in this very tower, of course! Do you get it?<br> 
If this world fears destruction, I'm certain that whoever concocted the crisis will also be the ones who will stop it! Of course, I'm talking about the Mystics of the Tower.<br>
