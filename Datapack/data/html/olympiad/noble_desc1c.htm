<html><body>Grand Olympiad Manager :<br><br>
These are the rules to the Grand Olympiad. Games are divided into two categories. The first, is a game that allows you to compete without class distinction. The second allows you to compete only against someone of the same class.<br><br>
To become a Hero through the Grand Olympiad, you must win the most games. Winners and losers are determined by how much damage the players directly inflicts upon their opponent. If damage is inflicted to the Summoner's Servitor, Maestro's Golem, or Hell Knight's Dark Panther, it does not have any influence on the scores in the game.<br><br>
If you win, you will take 1/3 of the loser's Grand Olympiad points.<br><br>
Players are given an initial allotment of amount of points when the Grand Olympiad perioed stats. From there, they may recieve points periodically. Players must have at least one Grand Olympiad point to participate in the games.<br><br>
