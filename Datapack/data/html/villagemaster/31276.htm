What in the world are you doing there?! Don't be shy; come here so I can get a good look at you. I won't bite, I promise!<br>
Ah, you certainly look like a person of quality. I'm not surprised -- after all, the best warriors gather here at Goddard.<br>
I have noticed a number of talented young people coming here lately; I don't know what that portends for the future, but I can practically smell the excitement in the air!<br>
