Hmm. The world is becoming more dangerous each day. You need guards just to transport cargo from Giran's port to the village! Naturally, all this insecurity leads to price increases. We're better off here in Innadril than Giran, though, with its port so far from the town. Here we can unload, warehouse and market all the goods as efficiently as possible. Gesto of Giran may gnash his teeth in anger at the thought of it, but the fact is that Heine and Innadril will rule the means of distribution!<br>
