<html><body>High Priest Baryl:<br>
Do you actually think Schuttgart will remain at peace forever? Bah!<br>
Clearly, the mountainous terrain and inhospitable climate are all that keep the peace around here! Even now, gruops of desperate bandits threaten our very existence! Life here may seem tranquil, but we don't move against these bandits, our doom is sealed! Mark my words!<br>
We need strong Warriors as well as Priest like us if we are ever to defend our borders!<br>
