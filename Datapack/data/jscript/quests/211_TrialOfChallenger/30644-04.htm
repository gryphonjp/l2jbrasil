Do you know of the Neutral Zone that lies between the land of the Elves and the Dark Elves? I have heard that<font color="LEVEL"> Shisrasis</font>, a medusa that has lived for many hundreds of years, makes her home there. Of course, these stories always include an extraordinary amount of treasure. Would you go to the cave, terminate everything that lives there, and bring back the treasure?<br>
You may keep all of the treasure you find, but if you by chance find a piece of<font color="LEVEL"> old sheepskin</font>, please give that to me. What do you think?<br>
