<center>Give me the scroll of ancient magic and step back...</center><br>
...the light of purification. It is cast on the shadows. The flames of soul... burning up the darkness...<br>
It's done. The magic is removed. Here is the <font color="LEVEL">blank scroll</font> I promised you.<br>
This blank scroll will be helpful to you when you trade with the<font color="LEVEL"> Merchant of Mammon</font>who appears in the sacred area once in a while.<br>
If you would like to collect more blank scrolls, enter the sacred area, slay the <font color="LEVEL">guardians of ancient cult</font> and bring me back more <font color="LEVEL">scrolls of ancient magic</font>.<br>
