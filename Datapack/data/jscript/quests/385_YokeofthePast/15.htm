To protect this sacred area from the Crusaders of light, there are the<font color="LEVEL"> undead and demons</font>, that have been summoned by the shamans of ancient magic who worship the Goddes of Death. They call themselves by the names of<font color="LEVEL"> watchman, watcher, sentinel, monk, overlord, priest, archon, inquisitor, guardian, wiseman, royal guard and preacher</font>.<br>
Bear in mind that you should not hurt nephilims, lilims, giants, and lithes. They are the forces of the gods and sacred warriors. So, don't dare to touch them with your sword.<br>
