<html><body>Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br>
Good choice! Now go to the dungeon, slay<font color="LEVEL"> the guardians of ancient cult</font>, and bring back the<font color="LEVEL"> scrolls of ancient magic</font>.<br>
When you bring me the scroll, I will remove the magic power it contains and turn the scroll into a<font color="LEVEL"> blank scroll</font>. A blank scroll is the only reward I can offer you.<br>
Have you heard of<font color="LEVEL"> Merchant of Mammon</font> who often appears in the dungeon area? He will be very interested in a blank scroll. You will find out more when you meet him. It wont be easy to find him though...<br>
