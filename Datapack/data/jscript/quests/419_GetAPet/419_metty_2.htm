So, you want to learn about the pets? Good, I will teach you everything.<br>
First of all, I'll tell you about the wolves, since it is the first pet that
 you will breed. A wolf, is an animal whose sense of smell can reach an object
 as far as<font color="LEVEL"> 2.4 km</font> away. Also when they hunt, 
they have a habit of forming a pack of 7-14 with a 
<font color="LEVEL">male</font> leader in front.<br>
Concerning their appearance, a fully grown wolf won't necessarily be heavier 
than a grown-up man. The difference from a dog, which is a tamed animal, is 
that wolves always have their tail dangling down.</body></html>
