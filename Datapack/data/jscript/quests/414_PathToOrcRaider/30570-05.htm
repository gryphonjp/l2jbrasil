Prefect Karukia:<br>
Then, l will give you a test! Orc Marauders are completed when they show courage that is unafraid of death and loyalty that is absolute. First, you must prove your loyalty. Destroy the<font color="LEVEL"> goblins</font> that spoil the earth and the<font color="LEVEL"> kuruka ratman leaders</font> that control that filthy race!<br>
Take this map. It is marked with the places where there are goblin tribes. If you obliterate the goblin leaders there, a kuruka ratman leader will appear, so make sure not to let him get away! We do not need captives. Remember, you must kill at least ten kuruka ratman leaders. Plant the power and fear of the Orcs into the enemy's heart!
