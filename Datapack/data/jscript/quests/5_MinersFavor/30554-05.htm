<html><body>Miner Bolter:<br>
By the gods! You are as forgetful as Bruno ... I will explain one more time! Don't forget!<br>
First go to the weapon & armor shop and get a sack of boomboom powder from<font color="LEVEL"> Trader Charly</font> ...<br>
Then, go to the general shop and get a pair of mining boots from<font color="LEVEL"> Trader Garita.</font> ...<br>
After that, go to the warehouse and get a case of Redstone beer from<font color="LEVEL"> Warehouse Chief Reed</font> ...<br>
Finally, pick up a miner's pick from<font color="LEVEL"> Blacksmith Bruno</font>. If Bruno's forgetfulness kicks in, the object I gave you will be of help. That's the best remedy for forgetfulness.
