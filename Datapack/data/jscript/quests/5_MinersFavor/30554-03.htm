<html><body>Miner Bolter:<br>
Ha ha! Very nice! This is the list of things that you need to bring. Let me see ... What were they ...?<br>
Ah! First, go to the weapon & armor shop and get a sack of boomboom powder from<font color="LEVEL"> Trader Charly</font> ...<br>
Then go to the general shop and get a pair of mining boots from<font color="LEVEL"> Trader Garita.</font> ...<br>
After that, go to the warehouse and get a case of Redstone beer from<font color="LEVEL"> Warehouse Chief Reed</font> ...<br>
Finally, pick up a miner's pick from<font color="LEVEL"> Blacksmith Bruno</font>.<br>
But I'm worried about the last one, because Blacksmith Bruno is very forgetful. He forgets orders and says strange things ... Just in case ... Here, take this. It is a specific remedy that works wonders for forgetfulness.
