You're not here for the merchandise, are you?<br>
So you want to travel? ...To the outside world? You adventurous young Elves are getting younger all the time... It makes me feel so melancholy... You know, it's very different out there! Nothing at all like this peaceful forest that's protected by the Mother Tree!<br>
There are many different races out in the world, and their customs can seem strange or even barbaric to us Elves! Are you sure you want to go there?<br>
