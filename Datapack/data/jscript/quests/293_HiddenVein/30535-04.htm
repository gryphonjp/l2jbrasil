I am sorry, but if you come back with empty hands I can't reward you, no matter how hard you tried. As I mentioned before, I will reward you based on the amount of<font color="LEVEL"> crysolite ore</font> that you collect after defeating<font color="LEVEL"> the Utuku Orcs</font>.<br>
And don't forget ...<font color="LEVEL">If you collect four pieces of a torn map, you should visit Chichirin in the Maphr Temple</font>. If you ask her for help, she will combine those torn pieces and make a complete map. I will give you a generous reward once you bring me the completed maps.<br>
