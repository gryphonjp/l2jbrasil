Quest scripts define the complete or near-complete flow of events that take place from the 
start to the end of a quest.  This includes, but is not limitted to, starting and accepting 
the quest, following complex dialogs, attacking or killing mobs, finding quest items, spawning
quest mobs, completing a quest, and getting rewards.

In order for quest scripts to function properly, at least 3 classes must be imported from Java:
from com.l2jbr.gameserver.model.quest import State
from com.l2jbr.gameserver.model.quest import QuestState
from com.l2jbr.gameserver.model.quest.jython import QuestJython as JQuest

In addition, the jython library "sys" is generally imported for convinience.  More classes can
be imported as needed, in order to access other components of the core and enhance the abilities
of the script.

Jython quest scripts essentially inherit from the Java class com.l2jbr.gameserver.model.quest.Quest
Developers who are comfortable with Java may read the source code for this class, as provided by the
l2jserver project (www.l2jserver.com) for full details and available functions.  Alternatively, one
may read forward in this documentation.


AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:
There exist a set of functions that are predefined for quests and are triggered from various actions.
These functions, their triggers, and the parameters passed into the script are defined below:

1) onEvent(self, event, st)
	This function is called whenever a player clicks on a link in a quest dialog.  
	The	parameter "st" contains a reference to the QuestState of the player who used the link.
	The parameter "event" contains a string identifier for the event.  Generally, this string
		is passed directly via the link.  For example:
		<a action="bypass -h Quest 626_ADarkTwilight 31517-1.htm">hello</a>
		The above link sets the event variable to "31517-1.htm" for the quest 626_ADarkTwilight
	The parameter "self" is a reference to the quest itself.  You may use self.XXXX where XXXX is
		any function defined in the parent class of your quest.
2) onAttack(self, npc, player)
	This function is called whenever a player attacks an NPC that is registered for the quest
	The parameter "npc" contains a reference to the exact instance of the NPC that got attacked
	The parameter "player" contains a reference to the exact instance of the player who attacked.
	The parameter "self" works the same as in onEvent.
3) onKill(self, npc, player)
	This function is called whenever a player kills an NPC that is registered for the quest
	All parameters are the same as in onAttack
4) onTalk(self,npc, player)
	This function is called whenever a player clicks to the "Quest" link of an NPC that is registered 
	for the quest.
	All parameters are the same as in onAttack
5) onFirstTalk(self,npc, player)
	This function is called whenever a player talks to an NPC that is registered for the quest.  That is, 
	it is triggered from the very first click on the NPC, not via another dialog.
	NOTE: Each NPC can be registered to at most one quest for triggering this function.  In other words, 
		the same one NPC cannot respond to an "onFirstTalk" request from two different quests.
		Attempting to register an NPC in two different quests for this function will result in one of the
		two registration being ignored.
	NOTE: Since a Quest link isn't clicked in order to reach this, a quest state can be invalid within this
		function.  The coder of the script may need to create a new quest state (if necessary), by using:
		st = self.newQuestState(player)	
	All parameters are the same as in onAttack.
6) onDeath (self, npc, character, st) 
	This function is called whenever an exact INSTANCE of a character who was previously registered for this 
	event dies.  The registration for onDeath events is NOT done via the quest itself, but it is instead handled
	by the QuestState of a particular player.
	The parameter "npc" contains a reference to the exact instance of the NPC that KILLED the character.
	The parameter "character" contains a reference to the exact instance of the character that got killed.
	The parameter "st" contains a reference to the QuestState of whomever was interested (waiting) for this kill
	The parameter "self" works the same as in onEvent.
7) REGISTRATION FUNCTIONS:
	The functions described below have a single purpose: To register an NPC for event triggers.  Simply put,
	an NPC must be registered in a quest for a particular event in order for the NPC to respond to the occurence
	of thatevent.  
	Registration Functions are NOT called automatically.  Instead, they should be added at the bottom of your 
	quest script.
	Descriptions of all registration functions follow:
	a) addStartNpc(npcId)
		Registers an NPC for onTalk events.  These NPCs are considered start NPCs.  Therefore, the player
		does NOT need to have started the quest in order to access the onTalk section of the quest.
		Instead, when a player talks to NPCs registered by addStartNpc, then the players automatically get
		a CREATED state for this quest.
		The parameter "npcId" contains the id of the template for this NPC.
	b) addTalkId(npcId)
		Registers an NPC for onTalk events.  These NPCs are not considered start NPCs (unless they are also
		registered with addStartNpc).  NPCs registered using addTalkId will only respond to the player's
		click of a "Quest" link if and only if the player has alredy started the quest.
		The parameter "npcId" contains the id of the template for this NPC.
	c) addAttackId(npcId)
		Registers an NPC for onAttack events.  The players do NOT need to be registered for the quest in order
		to trigger a response to an attack against this NPC.  
		The parameter "npcId" contains the id of the template for this NPC.
	d) addKillId(npcId)
		Registers an NPC for onKill events.  The players do NOT need to be registered for the quest in order
		to trigger a response to this NPC getting killed.
		The parameter "npcId" contains the id of the template for this NPC.

Quest:
After writing your script, in order to initialize your quest and register it with the game server, near the 
bottom of your script, you must use:
	QUEST       = Quest(id,"12345_QuestName","Description")
For example:
	QUEST       = Quest(626,"626_ADarkTwilight","A Dark Twilight")
It is often useful to define the quest name in a variable at the top of the script (typically called "qn").  
In that case, you may register your quest using:
	QUEST       = Quest(626,qn,"A Dark Twilight")

QuestState:
A QuestState is not part of the quest definition itself, but it contains the information that tracks the 
progress of a particular player for this quest.  Given a player instance, the quest-state of that player for 
this quest can be found using:
	st = player.getQuestState("12345_questname")
If the player does NOT have a quest-state for this quest (i.e. the player is not currently doing this quest), then
st will be null.
In addition, the queststate of a random party member who has a particular variable and value stored for this quest,
can be discovered using:
	partyMember = self.getRandomPartyMember(player,"variable","value")
	st = partyMember.getQuestState("12345_questname")
Similarly, the queststate of a random party member who has reached a particular STATE for this quest,
can be discovered using:
	partyMember = self.getRandomPartyMemberState(player,STATE)
	st = partyMember.getQuestState("12345_questname")
For example, instead of "variable" and "value" in the first sample, one may use "cond" and "1".  Instead of STATE in 
the second sample, one may use STARTED
While a QuestState can be discovered from a player, it can also access the player instance back when needed, using
	st.getPlayer()
All other public methods of implementation of QuestState are accessible from jython.  Similarly, objects
reachable from st can be further used in order to reach deeper.  For example, one may do something like:
	st.getPlayer().getClan().getLeader().getPlayerInstance().getPet()
	(this example may not be fully accurate or may get deprecated in the future...it is only meant as a 
	little demonstation of how one may reach deeper into a chain of objects that are accessible.  In this
	case, from the QuestState, we get the player whose QuestState this is, then get that player's clan,
	the clan's leader, the leader's actual player instance, and from there, we find the leader's summonned pet!)
	

STATE:
States are used to track segments of the quest.  Each state has its own list of quest items that may be found.  
Upon completion or aborting of a quest, or upon changing from one state to another, STATES take care of cleaning up
the excess quest items from a player's inventory.  To define a state, one must use:
	STATEVARIABLE     = State('StateName', QUEST)
for example:
	STARTED     = State('Started', QUEST)
The CREATED state is mandatory!  All quests must have it.  It is defined as:
	CREATED     = State('Start', QUEST)	
The COMPLETED state is mandatory for non-repeatable quests.  It is defined as:
	COMPLETED     = State('Completed', QUEST)
Other states can be created arbitarily.  Commonly used states are "Starting","Started","Progress" or 
states like "PartXXXX" (Part1, Part2, etc)
