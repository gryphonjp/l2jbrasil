Yes. We must not lose the opportunity given to us by our<br1>
god. But neither can we afford to act rashly in such<br1>
delicate times, lest we make things even worse.<br>
First we must discover what each race knows about the<br1>
Kamael and how they plan to win them over. We know<br1>
that they would not have revealed their true intentions<br1>
during the Giran Treaty summit, and Sir Klaus Vasper, the<br1>
Human representative, was unable to penetrate their<br1>
deception.<br>
You must learn the truth and then return and report to<br1>
Dominic in Rune Township. This is a dangerous task, make<br1>
no mistake about it! But Dominic has already sought out a<br1>
Grand Master or a guild master from each race --<br1>
collaborators from whom we can learn much. Do you have<br1>
the fortitude, the courage and the wit to undertake this<br1>
task and see it through to the end? The fate of the<br1>
Human race may well depend on you...
