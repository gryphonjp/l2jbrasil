Ah, ah. Gran Kain! And Antharas, lord of all the creatures of this land with scales and four 
legs...! What kind of meeting is this...? This child of the race that has stabbed many of us 
to death says he will go and recover my children...<br>Thank you, child of the race that walks 
on two legs. As I've already said, the ones that stole my eggs are the<font color="LEVEL"> leto 
lizardman warriors</font>. Those creatures... seem to be located<font color="LEVEL"> near the 
fortress that you call Oren Castle</font>. There are a<font color="LEVEL"> total of 20 eggs</font> 
that those creatures stole. Kill them and get my eggs...<br>I'll give you one of my scales. 
If you look at the pattern, you'll be able to tell the difference between the eggs of other 
creatures that they stole and my eggs. Take it.</body></html>
