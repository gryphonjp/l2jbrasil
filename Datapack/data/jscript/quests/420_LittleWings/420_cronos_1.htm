<html><body>Sage Cronos:<br>Let me guess. You came here to get yourself a hatchling right? 
Well, I think you should reconsider! It can’t fight but eats like a pig. You can’t 
ride on it but instead you will have to escort it like it is your master. Why are you 
looking for something that will give you nothing but trouble and heartache? I guess you 
would like to grow it well to become a Wyvern. If it was as easy as you think, I, the great 
sage, would be riding one rather than just sitting here like this wouldn’t I?<br>
You should not expect so much from a pet. A pet should just be cute and cuddly. Expecting 
other things from a pet doesn’t stand to reason at all. Humph… I don’t approve your choice 
at all… just like a wolf, a hatchling is not something you want to keep as a pet. No, no way…
