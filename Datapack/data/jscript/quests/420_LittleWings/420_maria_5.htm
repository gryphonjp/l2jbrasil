<html><body>Maria:<br>... I'm almost done now. If I absorb the impurities with the toad lord back skin...<br>
OK! I'm done. It's an extremely transparent jewel... Like clear water, it doesn't have any color 
at all. I've never seen a jewel like this... Even though I made it, I'm still really amazed. Oh, 
here.<br>In my experience, this kind of jewel is very delicate so please treat it with care.
