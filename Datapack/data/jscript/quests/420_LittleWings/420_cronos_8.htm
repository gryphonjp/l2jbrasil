<html><body>Sage Cronos:<br>
What did you say? You made a fairy stone? Are you serious? I didn’t expect it to work…! Well now, 
show it to me. Hmm, oh oh… wow! This is how it looks huh. Even a great sage like myself has never 
seen this before with my own eyes. Hmm… I wonder what you need to do from here…?<br>Oh, I know! 
You know<font color="LEVEL"> Byron the guard of this village</font>... He is a native here, and he 
seems to know all sorts of things such as fairies and stuff like that. I think you should go ask 
him about what to do next. Yes, yes… I really think you should go see him!</body></html>
