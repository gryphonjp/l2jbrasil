It looks like you haven't been able to become the owner of a hatchling yet. 
Recently, there seem to be those buying hatchlings with money easily in the marketplace but 
you seem to be a traditionalist. Ha, ha! Keep trying... A pet that one obtains through great 
effort is a true pet indeed. Anyway, if you get a hatchling, we'll be glad to take care of it 
in our pet kennel so just bring it on over. Well, we don't care if they are wolves or 
hatchlings... How different can they be?
