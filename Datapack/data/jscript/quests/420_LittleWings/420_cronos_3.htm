<html><body>Sage Cronos:<br>
Hey you stubborn youngster! Why did you cut off the front part of what I was saying 
and only choose to listen to the part you like? Fairies do not exist in this world any more! 
A very long time ago, they became so disgusted of the wicked ways of humans and they all flew 
away to another world! If you still insist on meeting them, you can go to the<font color="LEVEL"> 
Enchanted Valley</font> and search for them… But the place is very dangerous. If someone like 
yourself enters the area, in the blink of an eye, you could turn into manure for pretty flowers. 
Understand?<br>

Anyway, you were saying that I will need to go to the Enchanted Valley, right?
