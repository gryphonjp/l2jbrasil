<html><body>Fairy Mimyu:<br>Have you not yet been able to meet the ones looking for their eggs? Why not? Is it because the mountain was 
too high? Uh, huh... Perhaps, did you forget the locations that I told you? OK, I'll tell you again. Please remember it well!<br>
I'll start with the closest place...<font color="LEVEL"> Drake Exarion is at the top of the mountain to the west of Oren 
Castle.</font> It's a place that's extremely difficult to access for you races that can't fly.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Kalibran, who is also a drake, is at the top of another mountain to the south-west of Oren Castle.</font> 
Of course, that one is difficult to climb, too.<br><font color="LEVEL">Wyrm Suzet is looking for her eggs in the north-west 
side of the valley that you humans call Death Pass.</font> And that's also a steep place...<br>Ah... And, and if you go to 
the south from there...<font color="LEVEL"> Wyrm Shamhai is looking for eggs in the low mountains to the west of Death Pass.
</font><br>And finally,<font color="LEVEL"> Drake Zwov is in the reservoir to the east of Lake Iris.</font> You can get 
there easily...</body></html>
