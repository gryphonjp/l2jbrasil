There are drakes and wyrms near here looking for eggs that they lost. The hand of evil caused it all... What were they 
thinking when they took those eggs? Really...!<br>Anyway, what I know is that there are five of those creatures who had 
their eggs stolen.<br>Starting from the closest place...<font color="LEVEL"> Drake Exarion is at the top of the mountain 
to the west of Oren Castle.</font> It's a place that's extremely difficult to access for you races that can't fly.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Kalibran, who is also a drake, is at the top of another mountain to the south-west of Oren Castle.</font> 
Of course, that one is difficult to climb, too.<br><font color="LEVEL">Wyrm Suzet is looking for her eggs in the north-west 
side of the valley that you humans call Death Pass.</font> And that's also a steep place...<br>Ah... And, and if you go to 
the south from there...<font color="LEVEL"> Wyrm Shamhai is looking for eggs in the low mountains to the west of Death Pass.
</font><br>And finally,<font color="LEVEL"> Drake Zwov is in the reservoir to the east of Lake Iris.</font> You can get 
there pretty easily...<br>Yeah, it would be good to go and meet them. They have all lost their eggs and are not in their 
right minds but I'll give you one thing. This is juice of monkshood. It's a strong poison to your race but it will bring 
a wyrm or drake to his senses. If you take this and stick it to the nose of one of these creatures, they will do what you say.
