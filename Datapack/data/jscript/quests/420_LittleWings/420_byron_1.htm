<html><body>Guard Byron:<br>
How to meet a fairy? Ha, ha... Is there just one way? And if such a method exists, I'd like to 
know too. First, the fairies have a way of thinking that Humans like me can't understand. They can 
seem to be really afraid but then they'll easily drop their guard and become friendly. Or they'll 
act crueler than a demon and do unexpected things... They'll show you what they want you to see.
