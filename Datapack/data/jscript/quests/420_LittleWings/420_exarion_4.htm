OK... I remember the promise we made. In the name of Antharas... I'll give you one of my eggs as 
I promised. But hurry. If I, the mother, don't take care of it, my baby inside the egg will lose 
it's strength and die soon. Take that egg to<font color="LEVEL"> Fairy Mimyu in Fairy Valley</font>. 
Her magical powers will be able to protect the baby inside the egg. I am thankful for what you've 
done for me. Go now... and hurry...!</body></html>
