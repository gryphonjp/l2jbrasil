Hmm, the jewel that I made for you before... That was such a curious jewel. If it doesn't have a 
certain degree of strength, then it will be useless as an ornament. The stone seemed to be weak 
and extremely sensitive... Don't you think it would have been made for a special purpose?<br>
OK, by the way, something that Dwarves can use to craft mithril or adamantite... I was asked if 
I could make a jewel that is harder than a diamond... Thanks to you, I forgot for a moment.
