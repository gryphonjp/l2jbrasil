It's something that happened to me when I was very young and so I don't remember well, 
but... If there are still fairies living in Enchanted Valley, the location that I'm thinking 
about is<font color="LEVEL"> the deepest place in the north of the valley</font>. Take that 
fairy stone and try talking to a fairy there. If you're lucky, a fairy will talk to you.</body></html>
