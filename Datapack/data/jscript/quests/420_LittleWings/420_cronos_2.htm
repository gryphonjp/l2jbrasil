… Boy, how can you say the most embarrassing things like that with a straight face! Oh man! 
Oh, that makes my skin crawl… Look at my face. I’m blushing! No matter how hard you try, 
it cannot be raised properly by a race like ours. Yes... hear what I say. Maybe the fairies 
who disappeared long time ago could, but not us… If you can find a fairy, you can babble 
about your love and stuff like that. Maybe a fairy will listen to you and grant your wishes. 
 Pwa ha ha ha!<br>
