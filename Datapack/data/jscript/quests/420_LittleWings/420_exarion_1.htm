<html><body>Drake Exarion:<br>
Hey, you of a race that walks on two legs. Why have you come up this tall mountain? If you're planning to kill me with that weapon of yours, please do it now. Those worthless<font color="LEVEL"> leto lizardman warriors</font> stole my eggs. I've killed countless lizardmen looking for the eggs but I still haven't been able to find them. I have been so injured and heartbroken that I don't even have the energy to kill any more of those worthless lizard tribesmen. If you have the sense of justice spoken of by your gods, please help me. What you want is an egg inside which my baby is sleeping, right? If you get me all the eggs that I lost, I'll give you one of them. This proposal demonstrates the extent of my pain like a claw scratching at my heart. Will you accept?<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 420_LittleWings exarion_1">Accept the proposal of Drake Exarion.</a>
