<html><body>Sage Cronos:<br>
I never met a fellow who is as hard of hearing as yourself! Are you still insisting on going 
there even when I said you would be killed? Sigh! Humph … I did warn you. So, don’t blame 
me if you end up being dead. You’re sure, right?<br>… I did put it somewhere here… Is this 
the book…? No no… was it this one…? All right, I found it!<br>
Listen to me carefully okay? Let’s assume that you luckily manage to sustain your life in the 
Enchanted Valley and meet a fairy. Do you think the fairy will listen to you and be obliged to 
grant your request? Of course not… The fairy will just ignore you without even wasting its 
time to snort at you. So! Hey, in order to find favor in a fairy’s eye, there is an item you 
will need! Would you like to know what it is? It is called a<font color="LEVEL"> fairy stone
</font>! It is not something you can buy anywhere. You have to collect its ingredients and make 
it yourself!<br>Hmm… and, there are two types of fairy stone. One is a regular fairy stone and 
the other is called a<font color="LEVEL"> fairy stone deluxe</font>. The difference between the 
two is like the riddle of the universe… and even a great sage like myself cannot figure it out.<br>
