You haven't forgotten our contract, have you? If you kill the<font color="LEVEL"> hobgoblins</font> and bring back<font color="LEVEL"> thirty tokens</font>, I will give you a sack of Dionian potatoes. Use your sword to get rid of the hobgoblins that trouble Dion's farmers, so they are not able to swagger around any more.
